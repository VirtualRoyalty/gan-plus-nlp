# Semi-supervised learning for NLP via `GAN`
---

Semi-supervised learning for NLP tasks via GAN. Such approach can be used to enhance models in terms of small bunch of labeled examples:
Supported tasks are following:

- [x] text classification (see `DiscriminatorForSequenceClassification`)
  - [x] multiple input text classification (e.g. NLI, paraprhase detection)
- [x] multi-label text classification (see `DiscriminatorForMultiLabelClassification`)
- [x] token classification (e.g. NER, see  `DiscriminatorForTokenClassification`)
- [x] multiple choice tasks (see `DiscriminatorForMultipleChoice`)
